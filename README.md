# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Sneha Mondal (@isnehamondal)

I'm a passionate Data Scientist, AI/ML enthusiast, and a Web Developer. 
I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and love collaborating on projects that create an impact.  
Iâ€™m continuously exploring new technologies and staying updated with the latest trends in AI, Machine Learning, and Open-Source Development.
- I enjoy picking up new languages(currently French) and exploring different cultures.
- Iâ€™m a table tennis and badminton enthusiast. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me at the table or court!
- I love public speaking and have participated in international MUNs, where I got the chance to connect with people from all over the world.
